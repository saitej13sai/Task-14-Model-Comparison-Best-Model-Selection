# Task-14-Model-Comparison-Best-Model-Selection
# Model Comparison – Titanic Survival Prediction

## Objective
Compare multiple classification algorithms and select the best-performing model.

## Models Compared
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## Best Model
Random Forest (based on F1 Score & Generalization)

## Key Insight
Decision Tree overfitted (high train accuracy, lower test accuracy).
Random Forest provided best balance between bias and variance.
